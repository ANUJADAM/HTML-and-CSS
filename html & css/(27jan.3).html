TRANSITIONS

Transitions

● CSS transitions allow you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.

To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:

● the CSS property you want to add an effect to

● the duration of the effect

Note: If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the
default value is 0.

Change Several Property Values

Specifying the Speed Curve of Transition

The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.

The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:

● ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is
default)
● linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
● ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
● ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
● ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
● cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function

Delay the Transition Effect

The transition-delay property specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect

Transition + Transformation

Using the shorthand property transition

Tooltip

Tooltip

● A tooltip is used to specify extra information about something when the user moves
the mouse pointer over an element.

● Basic Tooltip Example : a tooltip that appears when the user moves the mouse over
an element

Positioning Tooltips

The tooltip can be placed at any of the following locations:

● left
● right
● top
● bottom

Tooltip Arrows

● To create an arrow that should appear from a specific side of the tooltip, add "empty"
content after tooltip, with the pseudo-element class ::after together with the content
property.

● The arrow itself is created using borders. This will make the tooltip look like a speech
bubble.

● Arrows can appear at bottom, top, left or right

Faded Tooltips

● If you want to fade in the tooltip text when it is about to be visible, you can use the CSS
transition property together with the opacity property, and go from being completely
invisible to 100% visible, in a number of specified seconds -->
