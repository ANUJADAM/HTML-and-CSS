<!-- **Lecture Notes:
Introduction to audio in web pages:
We often see many websites, especially blogging sites with an audio player in
them. These audio players play the audio description of the blog. This is very
important when it comes to websites that have content to tell in a story format
or a website where the owner wants to share his thoughts with the audience
over voice.

HTML Audio:
HTML provides a way to play audio on web pages through the <audio> element.
The <audio> element is a self-closing tag, meaning it does not have a closing
tag, and it is used to embed audio files in web pages.
The <audio> tag creates an audio player on a web page. Along with playing the
audio, it supports media controls, like play, pause, volume, and mute. The
browser will choose the first file with a file format that it supports. Supported
audio file formats include MP3, WAV, and OGG.

Attributes:
● src.
● controls.
● muted.
● autoplay.

HTML Audio:
The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in
browsers that do not support the <audio> element.

HTML Source Tag:
Some browsers or hardware don’t support audio tag or audio formats. To
handle this sometimes we provide multiple audio types to the audio tag and let
the browser display what must be played. This can be done by the source tag. -->
