Introduction to CSS Layout

It is a very important part of web design which allows the developer to position the elements
on a web page so that the web page can be visually appealing and user friendly.
In other words, we can say that it is a process of using CSS to control the position and size of
elements on a web page.

1. Better presentation and structure
2. Better accessibility

Types of CSS Layout

1. Normal Flow
2. Float
3. Position
4. Flex
5. Grid

Normal Flow

It is the default layout model in which elements are rendered in the order they are written
in the HTML file.
It is the default and simplest layout model.

Example Code

Output

Float

Float property specifies how we can position an element within the container.
Float is majorly used when we want to align elements horizontally next to each other.

These are the most used properties of float to position the element-
1. none

2. left
3. right

none

This is the default property set on the element which means that the element will not float
anywhere and will be there according to the normal document flow.

Example Code

Output

left

This property will float (position) the element to the left side of the container, instead of
positioning the element with the default layout flow.

Example Code

Output

right

This property will float (position) the element to the right side of the container, instead of
positioning the element with the default layout flow.
