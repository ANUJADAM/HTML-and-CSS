Introduction to HTML.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard markup language for
creating web pages and web applications. It is the foundation of the World
Wide Web and is used to describe the structure of content in documents,
such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.

Introduction to HTML5.
HTML5 is the latest version of HTML and includes new features that allow web
developers to create more interactive and engaging content for the web.

Advantages of HTML
1. Easy and simple to use.
2. Widely supported by almost all web browsers.
3. The standard language for making the structure of the web pages.
4. Code is very lightweight, thus providing better speed online.
5. Free to use. And it can be run on browsers only, so there is no need to buy
any external software.

Disadvantages of HTML
1. Only capable of making static web pages that do not contain any
functionality or dynamic content.
2. Due to complex and long syntaxes, there are multiple lines of code
required even to make any web component.
3. There is no feature for syntax error detection. Thus if any error is made
while coding, it can only be detected after seeing the output. This could be
very harmful if the code is long and complicated.
4. The security features of HTML are almost none or very limited.
5. The HTML code is tough to understand and manage.

Advantages of HTML5
1. There are many attributes present in HTML5 that were not present in HTML.
E.g., data-, offline, onabort, onblur, etc.
2. It provides support for audio, video, and other multimedia content by
using tags like <audio>,<video>,<canvas>, etc.
3. There are many page layout options available in HTML5. In HTML, you can
only find page layout tags like div, span, etc. But in HTML5, there are many
more tag options available like header, footer, article, section, etc.
4. HTML5 supports Search Engine Optimisation(SEO). Search engine
optimization helps the websites to know about the popularity of their
content and also provides insights on how to improve the content to
increase the traffic on the websites.

Disadvantages of HTML5
1. Can only be run on modern browsers. Not compatible with older versions
of various browsers, e.g., Google Chrome version less than 60, Mozilla
version 2 and 3.6, etc.
2. There is no standard video format available. For example, H.264 video
format is supported by all web browsers but not by Firefox; similarly, the
Ogg Theory video format is supported by all web browsers but not by
Explorer.
3. The multi-platform support provided by HTML5 sometimes leads to more
complex code. Also, it becomes necessary to run all web applications in
all formats to check the credibility of the code.
4. HTML5 is still in the development phase; therefore, it might appear that a
few features that worked before are not working now. Thus developers
need to stay updated while using HTML5.
