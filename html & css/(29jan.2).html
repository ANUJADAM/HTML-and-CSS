Document Flow

The way elements are arranged on the web page is known as document flow.
Generally the default flow is from top to bottom or left to right on the basis of block
or inline element.

Types of CSS positions

1. Static
2. Relative
3. Absolute
4. Fixed
5. Sticky

Static

This is the default position set for all the HTML elements.

Properties of position static
1. It is the default position of an element.
2. It will not break the normal document flow to position the element on the page.
3. The properties like top, left, right, bottom and z-index have no effect to position
the element.

Note: We will learn more about z-index property in further classes.

Relative

The element will be positioned according to the normal document flow and will
change its position according to the given values of top, left, right and bottom.

Properties of position relative
1. It will not break the normal document flow to position the element on the page.
2. The properties like top, left, right, bottom and z-index will have an effect on the
element.
3. The element will leave the space at its original position.

Absolute

The element will break the normal document flow to position the element on the
page according to the given values of top, left, right and bottom.

Properties of position absolute
1. It will break the normal document flow to position the element on the page.
2. The properties like top, left, right, bottom and z-index will have an effect on the
element.
3. The element will not leave any space at its original position.
4. The element will be positioned in respect of its closest positioned ancestor.
5. If there is no positioned ancestor element then it will take the document body as
his ancestor.
Note: Positioned Ancestor means an element which will be using any position
property like relative, absolute, fixed or sticky.

Fixed

As the name suggests, the element will be fixed to a particular position on the page, which
means the element will be at the same position always even if the user scrolls the page.

Properties of position fixed
1. It will break the normal document flow to position the element on the page.
2. The element will be positioned relative to the browser window (width and height of
screen) and will be in the same position even if the user is scrolling the page.
3. The properties like top, left, right, bottom and z-index will have an effect on the element.
4. The element will not leave any space in its original position.

Example:- We can see the chat support icon on the PW Skills website, which is always fixed
on the bottom right side of the screen even if we scroll the page.

Sticky

The element is positioned based on the userâ€™s scroll position.

Properties of position sticky
1. It will not break the normal flow of the document to position the element on the page.
2. It toggles between the position relative and fixed.
3. It will behave like a relative position unless it reaches the given position, after reaching
the given position it will behave like a fixed position.
4. The properties like top, left, right, bottom and z-index will have an effect on the element.
5. It will work only if any of the property (top, left, right or bottom) is specified. -->
