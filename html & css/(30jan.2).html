Different flexbox property

Different flexbox property

Flexbox offers a variety of properties to create layout efficiently. Generally we can

categorise the flexbox properties into two parts-
1. Flex Container Properties

2. Flex Items Properties

Flex Container Property

These are the properties that are used over the flex container (parent container).

Flex container properties are as follows-
a. display

b. flex-direction
c. flex-wrap
d. flex-flow
e. justify-content
f. align-items
g. align-content
h. gap
i. row-gap
ii. column-gap

Flex Items Property

These are the properties that are used over the flex items (child elements). Flex

items properties are as follows-
a. order

b. flex-grow
c. flex-shrink
d. flex-basis
e. flex
f. align-self

Display property

It is used to define a flex container. After defining a flex container using display flex
or inline-flex, it will enable a flex context for all its direct children and will allow
users to use flex properties over the flex container and its flex items respectively.

Difference between flex and inline-flex

The major difference between two is that the display:inline-flex will make the flex
container display inline but will not make flex items display inline.

Flex Direction Property

It is used to define the direction in which all the flex items should be laid out. By
default the flex direction of a flex container is row to which we can change by using
this property.

There can be four values of a flex direction-
1. row

2. row-reverse
3. column
4. column-reverse

Flex Wrap Property

This property is used to define whether the flex items should wrap themself to fit
the container width or not if the total required width of flex items are more than the
flex container width.

Flex wrap can have three possible values-
1. nowrap

2. wrap
3. wrap-reverse

Flex Flow Property

It is a shorthand property for setting both flex-direction and flex-wrap properties in
one line.

Syntax- flex-flow: flex-direction flex-wrap

Justify Content Property

It is used to align the flex items along with the main axis of the container within the
flexbox layout.

It can have these possible values-
1. flex-start

2. flex-end
3. center
4. space-between
5. space-around
6. space-evenly

Align Items Property

It is used to align the flex items along with the cross axis of the container within the
flexbox layout.

It can have these possible values-
1. stretch

2. flex-start
3. flex-end
4. center
5. baseline

Align Content Property

This property is used to align a flex containerâ€™s lines within it when there is extra
space in the cross axis, similar to that of justify-content property which works on
the main-axis. There should be more than one line to function the align content.

It can have these possible values-
1. stretch

2. flex-start
3. flex-end
4. center
5. space-between
6. space-around

Gap Property

This property defines the amount of space between the rows and columns of a flex
container. The gap is a shorthand property for defining the row-gap and
column-gap.

Syntax
1. gap:10px;
This is similar to row-gap:10px and column-gap:10px

2. gap:10px 20px
This is similar to row-gap:10px and column-gap:20px -->
