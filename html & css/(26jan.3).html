Serif: Fonts with serifs have little lines at the ends of the characters. Georgia, Times New Roman,
and other serif font examples.

Sans-serif: Characters in a sans-serif typeface don't have little lines at the ends. Arial, Verdana,
and other sans-serif font examples.

Font weight

● The weight and boldness of a font are defined via the CSS font weight parameter.
