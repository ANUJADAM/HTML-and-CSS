Introduction to CSS Selectors.
CSS selectors are used for selecting the HTML elements that you want tostyle, and they are a fundamental part of working with CSS. In theory,selectors are patterns used to select the elements to which a set of styles will
be applied. CSS selectors can be used to select elements based on their type,class, ID, attributes, or dynamic state or position.

Types of CSS Selectors
We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

1. Simple selectors.
2. Combinators.
3. Attribute selectors.
4. Pseudo-class selectors.
5. Pseudo-elements selectors.

NOTE: CSS Selectors cannot be used with inline CSS.

We will be using internal CSS to demonstrate CSS Selectors.
Simple Selectors A simple selector is either a type selector or a universal selector. Simple selectors are pretty straightforward and used most of the time in
development.

Simple Selectors include
1. Universal Selector.
2. Element Selector.
3. Class Selector.
4. ID Selector.
5. Selector list.

Universal Selector:

The universal selector(*) applies the same styles to every element on the
page.
Asterisk (*): symbol denotes the universal selector in CSS.

Element Selector:
The Element Selector only selects all the instances of a tag or element present
on the webpage.

Class Selector:
The CSS class selector is probably the most useful and used selector, it selects
all elements that have given the class value in their class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed
by the name of the class.

ID Selector:
ID selectors are the most powerful in terms of CSS specificity, just like the class
selector, it targets specific elements in our HTML document that we can then
use as a reference in our CSS.

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by
the id of the element.

NOTE: IDs must be always unique and each element must have only one id to
identify the element uniquely.

Selector List:
The CSS selector list (,) allows us to select multiple elements with different
selectors at once and style them. We have more than one thing which uses
the same CSS then the individual selectors can be combined into a selector
list so that the rule is applied to all of the individual selectors.

This is done by grouping them in a comma-separated list and CSS selects allthe matching elements in the list. -->
