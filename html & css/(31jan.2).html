2. Grid Layout properties.

Introduction to Grid Layout.

The Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for creating rows and
columns. It allows for creating flexible and responsive layouts that can adapt to
different screen sizes and devices.

Grid Layout properties.

We shall look at the grid properties in two ways
● Properties are to be applied on grid containers [ Parent ].
● Properties are to be applied to grid items [ Children ].

grid-template-columns

The grid-template-columns property defines the number of columns in your grid
layout, and it can define the width of each column.

The value is a space-separated-list, where each value defines the width of the
respective column.

If you want your grid layout to contain 5 columns, specify the width of the 5
columns, or "auto" if all columns should have the same width.

Special Units & Functions

repeat()
The repeat() function is used to reduce repetitive declarations.

fr units
The "fr" unit in CSS is a way to divide up the available space in a grid or layout. It is
used to specify how much of the space should be given to a certain element or
group of elements. It represents a fraction of the available space.

Sizing Functions

minmax()

The minmax() function in CSS is used to set a range of values for a property. It sets
a minimum and maximum value for a property.

grid-template-rows

The grid-template-rows property defines the height of each row. It is used to define
the number of rows and their size in a grid container.

grid-template-areas

The grid-template-areas property specifies areas within the grid layout.
● <grid-area-name> – the name of a grid area specified with grid-area.
● dot(.) - Represents the empty space in the template.

grid-template

The grid-template property in CSS is a shorthand property for setting the
grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid-template-areas
properties all at once. It allows you to define the structure of a grid layout in a
simple way.

The order of values in the grid-template property is as follows:
● grid-template-rows
● grid-template-columns
● grid-template-areas

The order should be : grid-template-rows / grid-template-columns /
grid-template-areas.

column-gap row-gap grid-column-gap
grid-row-gap

Specifies the gap. grid-column-gap is the old notation for column-gap,
grid-row-gap is the old notation for row-gap.

gap, grid-gap

A shorthand for row-gap and column-gap.

justify-items

The justify-items property in CSS is used to align the grid items along the horizontal
(x) axis within their grid cell. It applies to all grid items within the grid container.
● start – aligns items to be pushed to the start edge of their cell
● end – aligns items to be pushed to the end edge of their cell
● center – aligns items in the center of their cell
● stretch – fills the whole width of the cell (this is the default)

align-items

The align-items property in CSS is used to align the grid items along the vertical
(y) axis within their grid cell. It applies to all grid items within the grid container.

● start: Aligns the grid items to the top of the grid cell.
● end: Aligns the grid items to the bottom of the grid cell.
● center: Aligns the grid items to the center of the grid cell.
● stretch: Stretches the grid items to fill the entire height of the grid cell.

grid-column-start grid-column-end
grid-row-start grid-row-end

grid-column-start and grid-column-end properties are used to specify the
starting and ending of an grid-item along the horizontal (x) axis.

grid-row-start and grid-row-end properties in CSS are used to specify the starting
and ending of an grid-item along the vertical (y) axis.

justify-self

The justify-self property is used to align a specific grid item along the horizontal (x)
axis within its grid cell.

● start – aligns the grid item to be flush with the start edge of the cell
● end – aligns the grid item to be flush with the end edge of the cell
● center – aligns the grid item in the center of the cell
● stretch – fills the whole width of the cell (this is the default)

align-self

The align-self property is used to align a specific grid item along the vertical (y)
axis within its grid cell.

● start – aligns the grid item to be flush with the start edge of the cell
● end – aligns the grid item to be flush with the end edge of the cell
● center – aligns the grid item in the center of the cell
● stretch – fills the whole width of the cell (this is the default) -->
