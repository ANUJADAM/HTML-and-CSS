Introduction to lists in HTML
A list is a group of related items that are displayed in a specific order.
Lists are useful in websites for several reasons:
1. Lists can help to organize content in a clear and logical way, making it
easier for users to understand and navigate.
2. Lists can be used to break up large blocks of text and make the content
more visually appealing and easier to read.
3. Lists can be used to highlight important points or information, making it
easier for users to find and reference specific pieces of content.
4. Lists can be used to create navigation menus, allowing users to easily
move between different pages or sections of a website.

Types of Lists in HTML:
1. Unordered List.
2. Ordered List.
3. Description List.

1.Unordered List:
An unordered list in HTML is a list of items that are displayed in no specific
order. Unordered lists are created using the <ul> element in HTML, and each
item in the list is represented by an <li> element.
There can be 4 kinds of markers for unordered lists:
● disc
● circle
● square
● None
The markers can be applied both on <ul> and <li> tags using the ‘type’ attribute.

2. Ordered List
An ordered list in HTML is a list of items that are displayed in a specific
numerical or alphabetical order. Ordered lists are created using the <ol>
element in HTML, and each item in the list is represented by an <li> element.
There can be 5 kinds of markers for the ordered list:
● Numbers [ 1 ]
● Lowercase Alphabets [ a ]
● Uppercase Alphabets [ A ]
● Lowercase Roman Numbers [ i ]
● Uppercase Roman Numbers [ I ]

The markers can be applied both on <ol> and <li> tags using the ‘type’ attribute.

3.Description List
A description list in HTML is a way to display a list of terms and their
corresponding descriptions. It is similar to a dictionary, where each term is
followed by its definition. Description lists are created using the <dl>
element, with each term represented by an <dt> element and each
description represented by an <dd> element..


Introduction to Links:
Links (also known as hyperlinks) are used in websites to allow users to
navigate from one web page to another. When a user clicks on a link, they
are taken to the destination page specified by the link.
Use cases for links in HTML
1. Navigation
2. External references
3. Downloadable content
4. E-commerce
5. Social media

-The <a> element, also known as the anchor tag, is used in HTML to create a
 hyperlink. The <a> element allows you to specify the destination of the link
using the href attribute.
<a href="http://www.example.com">Example</a>

-Links can also be used to open emails or to download files. Here is an
example of a link that opens an email client:
<a href="mailto:abe@.example.com">send an email</a>

-Here is an example of a link that allows the user to download a file.
<a href="/file/my files.pdg" download>Download</a>Donload file</a>

*Attributes

1. href

2. target: This attribute specifies where the linked document should be
opened.
- _blank
- _self
- _parent
- _top

3. download: This attribute specifies that the linked document should be
downloaded rather than opened in the browser.

4. title: This attribute specifies a short description of the link, which is often
displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. -->
