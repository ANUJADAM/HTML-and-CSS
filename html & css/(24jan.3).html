<!-- Lecture Notes:
Inline CSS:
1. By using the inline CSS approach, CSS can be applied to a single element.
2. Another way to include style sheets in an HTML document is through inline CSS.
3. This strategy reduces some of the benefits of style sheets, so it is suggested that
you use them sparingly.
4. Utilize the style attribute on the appropriate tag if you wish to use inline CSS.

Advantages of Inline CSS:
● Inline takes precedence over all other styles. Any styles defined in the internal
and external style sheets are overridden by inline styles.
● You can quickly and easily insert CSS rules into an HTML page, which is useful
for testing or previewing changes and performing quick fixes on your website.
● There is no need to create an additional file.

Disadvantages of Inline CSS:
● Within inline CSS, quotations are not permitted. The browser will perceive the use of
quote marks as the end of your style value.
● These styles can't be applied elsewhere.
● Because they are not saved in a single location, these styles are difficult to update.
● Pseudo-codes and pseudo-classes cannot be styled with inline CSS.
● Inline CSS does not provide browser cache advantages. -->
